    <h2>Olena Slobodeniuk</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Olena and I'm from Ukraine. Now I'm located in France. I have the Pathway certificate and now I start my studying at Web and Computer Programming.
         I'm married and have 2 children.</p>
    <p>I'm a member of the Church since 1997. My favorite scripture is from D&C 6:7 "Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shell be unfolden unto you,
         and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich."</p>
    <p>I'm exited to spend this semeter with you!</p>
